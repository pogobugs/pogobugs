# Unofficial Bug Tracker for Pokémon GO

This is a curated, unofficial resource for Pokémon GO related bugs and issues, their status and any known workarounds.

This is not a place to report bugs. **Please use the [official channels](https://support.pokemongo.nianticlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/222061187-Report-a-bug) for reporting bugs and issues.**

However, if you wish to contribute, you can submit an issue, or discuss existing issues and provide additional information.

This is my personal project and represents my opinions on what is and is not a bug, but I strive to maintain a well-researched resource.
